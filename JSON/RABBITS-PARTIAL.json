With powerful vocals, climactic solos, and tight grooves, The Fritz has built a devoted following and is captivating audiences everywhere.\n \nOriginally formed in the rehearsal spaces of University of North Florida's School of Music, The Fritz discovered an immediate chemistry.  Drawing on influences such as Prince, Talking Heads and Jimi Hendrix, the quintet integrated their diverse musical tastes and began writing music together. \n\nWith their college days behind them, the Fritz soon set their eyes on the mountains of Western North Carolina, eventually settling in Asheville in July 2011. After the release of their 2012 debut album, Bootstrap, the band launched into a near-constant touring schedule. With appearances at festivals such as Hulaween, Wakarusa, and Catskill Chill, the band quickly gained a reputation as a live act not to be missed.\n \nThe band\u2019s 2017 release, Natural Mind, captures a sound that has been years in the making. \n\n\u201cWe intentionally waited to go back into the studio so that we could really work on the music and figure out what makes this band special,\u201d vocalist and keyboardist Jamar Woods said.\n\nFor the new album, The Fritz headed north to More Sound Studios in Syracuse, NY and enlisted the help of producer Dave Brandwein (Turkuaz, Galaxy Smith Studios) and engineers Jason \"Jocko\" Randall and Jose Varona to assist with the recording process.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to work with a producer whose work we respected and who we trusted to add a different perspective,\u201d percussionist Mikey \u201cSpice\u201d Evans said. \u201cDave played an invaluable role in producing our album.\u201d\n\nWhile most of the songs were written in the months leading up to recording, the studio environment allowed for some last minute additions and musical breakthroughs.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted to arrange these songs specifically for the studio, which was both challenging and fun for us\u201d guitarist Jamie Hendrickson said. \u201cNow we\u2019re very excited to get on the road and have these songs take on a life of their own.\u201d\n\nThe band is now taking the album and their unforgettable live performances around the country with the Natural Mind tour. \n\n Check out www.thefritzmusic.com for local tour dates near you.","end_time":"2017-09-24T02:00:00-0400","name":"The Fritz Natural Mind Album Release Show w\/OpenSoulProject - Charlotte, NC","place":{"name":"The Rabbit Hole","location":{"city":"Charlotte","country":"United States","latitude":35.21909,"longitude":-80.81372,"state":"NC","street":"1801 Commonwealth Ave","zip":"28205"},"id":"597990653636395"},"start_time":"2017-09-23T20:00:00-0400","id":"1483296475024030"},{"description":"Doors open at 8:00\nRobot Johnson Show starts at 9:00\nCrackers & Snackmeat after party happens after the Robot Johnson Sketch Comedy Show. \n\n21+\n\nParking in Plaza Midwood can be challenging, give yourself enough time to find parking.\n\nRobot Johnson is made up of an eclectic mix of actors, writers, stand ups, improv and sketch comedy veterans.
